## 🎯 Presentation Script

Here's a suggested script for demonstrating the system:

### Opening (30 seconds)
*"Today I'll demonstrate our Hivebot cluster management system. This shows how we can centrally control multiple trading bot instances from a single interface."*

### Bot Selection (30 seconds)
*"First, I select a target bot from our running cluster. You can see we have X bots online, each handling multiple strategies and executing trades per minute."*

### Strategy Deployment (60 seconds)
*"Now I'll deploy a new trading strategy instantly to this bot. I'll choose the aggressive market-making template... and click deploy."*

*[Click deploy, show loading state]*

*"As you can see, the strategy is being deployed to the bot in real-time. The system handles all the configuration, database updates, and bot communication automatically."*

### Results (30 seconds)
*"Perfect! The strategy is now live and will start executing within seconds. You can see it appears in our active strategies list with all its parameters."*

### Cleanup (30 seconds)
*"For our next demo, I'll remove all strategies from this bot to reset the environment."*

*[Click remove all strategies]*

*"And just like that, we've cleaned the slate for the next demonstration."*

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Integration
- Uses existing `/api/strategies` endpoints for adding/removing strategies
- Integrates with `/api/bots` for bot instance management
- Real-time data fetching every 3 seconds during demo

### Frontend-Only Design
- No new backend APIs required
- Leverages all existing hivebot-manager infrastructure
- Responsive React/TypeScript interface with Tailwind CSS

### Strategy Templates
All strategy configurations are predefined in the demo code for consistency:
- Conservative: 2% spreads, 30s refresh
- Aggressive: 0.5% spreads, 5s refresh  
- Arbitrage: Multi-level, 10s refresh

## 🎪 Demo Tips

### Before Your Presentation
1. **Test the Connection**: Visit /demo and ensure bots are detected
2. **Clean Slate**: Remove existing strategies for a fresh start
3. **Check Bot Status**: Verify at least one bot shows "Online"
4. **Test Deployment**: Try deploying and removing a strategy

### During Presentation
- **Keep It Moving**: Each step should take 30-60 seconds
- **Point Out Real-time Updates**: Highlight when numbers change
- **Show the Visual Feedback**: Draw attention to status indicators
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Use the reset button if needed

### Presentation Environment
- **Full Screen**: Use browser full-screen mode for maximum impact
- **Good Internet**: Ensure stable connection to avoid delays
- **Backup Plan**: Have the management dashboard open in another tab

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No running bots available"
- Check that at least one hivebot instance is running
- Verify the bot has registered with the manager (check /dashboard)
- Ensure the bot status shows "running" not "offline"

### Strategy deployment fails
- Check that the selected bot is actually online
- Verify the bot can accept new strategies
- Try refreshing the page to reset connection state

### Demo appears frozen
- Click the "🔄 Reset Demo" button in the top bar
- Refresh the browser page
- Check browser console for any error messages

## 🎯 Next Steps
